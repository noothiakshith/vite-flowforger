üß≠ Phase 1: Project Setup & Architecture
‚úÖ 1.1 Initialize Project and Install Dependencies
What you do:

Choose tools that are fast and industry-preferred: Vite, React, Tailwind, Zustand, React Router.

Decide project scope: it's frontend-only, so no backend-related code or API logic is needed.

Why this matters:

A strong base prevents technical debt.

Tailwind ensures rapid and consistent UI styling.

Zustand provides scalable, sliceable state architecture for multiple modules.

‚úÖ 1.2 Design Folder & Routing Structure
What you do:

Create a consistent folder system (pages, components, store, data).

Setup routing: /flows for dashboard, /flows/:id for flow editing.

Why this matters:

Ensures separation of concerns ‚Äî flows aren‚Äôt hardcoded.

You‚Äôre simulating a real SaaS UI with editable and shareable automations.

Each route can be enhanced later (e.g., query params for debug, templates, preview modes).

‚úÖ 1.3 Setup Zustand Stores
What you do:

Think modularly: separate stores for editor state, block library, configurations, and saved flows.

Each store manages only its own responsibility and communicates via state selectors.

Why this matters:

Keeps complexity manageable as features grow.

Makes it easy to debug and plug into components selectively.

Encourages composability ‚Äî can eventually swap in context or Redux if needed.

üß± Phase 2: Block Library (Triggers & Actions)
‚úÖ 2.1 Create a Central Library of Blocks
What you do:

Build a static set of mock "triggers" and "actions".

Each block has metadata (id, label, category, simulate function, inputs required).

Why this matters:

This is the brain of the system ‚Äî what you drag into the flow and simulate.

These blocks can later be exported or used to generate code.

‚úÖ 2.2 Load Blocks into Store
What you do:

Store all available blocks in a Zustand slice.

This store only provides access to the ‚Äúavailable‚Äù blocks, not flow state.

Why this matters:

Keeps your block definitions cleanly decoupled from flow execution.

Enables reusability across flows and editing tools.

‚úÖ 2.3 Render Sidebar Library UI
What you do:

Visually group blocks into Trigger and Action categories.

Add filter/search to help users find blocks.

Why this matters:

Users need a quick and intuitive way to explore building blocks.

Mimics the UX of professional tools like Zapier, n8n, and Webflow.

‚úÖ 2.4 Enable Drag & Drop (Conceptual)
What you do:

User should be able to drag a block onto the canvas.

Drop = create a new ‚Äúinstance‚Äù of that block with a unique ID.

Why this matters:

This is how users build flows: not by typing, but by interacting visually.

Drag-to-create logic is foundational for an intuitive builder.

üß© Phase 3: Canvas & Node Management
‚úÖ 3.1 Initialize a Visual Canvas System
What you do:

Use a visual library (like React Flow or Konva) to render nodes and links.

Abstract away complexity like zooming, panning, and connecting nodes.

Why this matters:

Provides professional, fluid interaction for building flows.

Your canvas is the ‚Äúworkspace‚Äù where automations are built and visualized.

‚úÖ 3.2 Handle Node Creation on Drop
What you do:

When a block is dropped, create a new node with unique ID, reference to block ID, and position.

Save this in the flow state (Zustand).

Why this matters:

Maintains separation between block type and block instance.

Enables each node to have its own config and identity.

‚úÖ 3.3 Manage Nodes and Edges in Store
What you do:

Track all current nodes and edges.

Add, remove, move, or reconnect nodes through flowEditorStore.

Why this matters:

Needed to simulate actual flows later.

Allows editing and versioning of flows.

‚úÖ 3.4 Support Node Linking and Visual Feedback
What you do:

Connect nodes from one to another visually.

Ensure links reflect execution order.

Why this matters:

You‚Äôre visually defining logic (A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C), so link integrity is essential.

Node connections represent the execution flow graph.

‚úÖ 3.5 Style and Differentiate Node Types
What you do:

Show different visuals for triggers and actions.

Possibly use icons or color coding.

Why this matters:

Users must immediately recognize what type of block they‚Äôre working with.

Enhances UX clarity and flow visualization.

‚öôÔ∏è Phase 4: Node Configuration Panel
‚úÖ 4.1 Show Config Panel on Selection
What you do:

When a user selects a node, open a side panel to edit its settings (email, timer interval, etc.).

Why this matters:

Real automations require user-defined data.

Configurable fields give power and flexibility to each node.

‚úÖ 4.2 Store Configs Per Node
What you do:

Use configStore to store each node‚Äôs config separately by node ID.

Why this matters:

Allows each node instance to have independent settings.

Keeps flow logic decoupled from UI elements.

‚úÖ 4.3 Render Dynamic Form Fields
What you do:

Based on the block metadata, render appropriate inputs (text, number, select).

Why this matters:

Enables generic and reusable config UI for all future blocks.

Lets you support unlimited block types.

üß™ Phase 5: Flow Execution Simulation
‚úÖ 5.1 Add Run Flow Button
What you do:

Add a button to simulate the execution of the current flow.

Why this matters:

Gives users feedback and proof of how their logic works.

Mimics real-world workflow engines.

‚úÖ 5.2 Find and Simulate the Trigger
What you do:

Start at the trigger node.

Call its simulate() function to generate initial data.

Why this matters:

Every flow must have a starting point.

The simulation mimics incoming webhook or data events.

‚úÖ 5.3 Recursively Pass Data Through Nodes
What you do:

Traverse connected nodes in order.

Call each action‚Äôs simulate(input) with the result of the previous node.

Why this matters:

Simulates actual logic pipelines (like chaining APIs).

Gives you a working frontend-only version of an automation engine.

‚úÖ 5.4 Show Output Log Panel
What you do:

Display execution logs or messages (success/failure, input/output).

Why this matters:

Provides transparency, debugging, and flow correctness.

Makes the tool usable even without real integrations.

üíæ Phase 6: Save/Load/Delete Flows
‚úÖ 6.1 Store Full Flow State
What you do:

Save current nodes, edges, and configs as a single flow object.

Why this matters:

Makes flows persistent and reusable.

Mimics real-world workflow versioning and templates.

‚úÖ 6.2 Create Flow Dashboard
What you do:

On home screen, list saved flows with titles, timestamps, and actions.

Why this matters:

Turns your app into a real productivity tool.

Mimics SaaS flow managers (like n8n‚Äôs dashboard or Zapier‚Äôs editor).

‚úÖ 6.3 Allow Flow Editing and Deletion
What you do:

Enable navigation to edit existing flows and remove them.

Why this matters:

Users expect full CRUD.

Aligns with industry UX expectations.

üé® Phase 7: UI/UX Enhancements
‚úÖ 7.1 Add UX Animations
What you do:

Animate node placement, transitions, and error states.

Why this matters:

Makes the tool feel polished and modern.

Improves clarity and confidence during use.

‚úÖ 7.2 Improve Accessibility and Dark Mode
What you do:

Use keyboard shortcuts, ARIA labels, and dark mode toggles.

Why this matters:

Expands usability and professional value.

Helps meet industry accessibility standards.
